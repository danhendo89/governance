# NGP001 Nodle Governance Proposal: Creation of the Nodle DAO

## Abstract

To further decentralization of the Nodle Network, and to further control of the network in the hands of the users, a Nodle DAO is proposed on-chain using a token weighted vote.

A simple on-chain voting mechanism is proposed, with an in-app vote being the ultimate goal. With a large userbase of Nodle smartphone users measuring in the hundreds of thousandsa large of users,Â  this would give control of the network to the communityusers. With NGP001 and simple in-app voting, The Nodle DAO has the potential to have the highest number of voters turnout of any decentralized governance system on chain.

## Motivation

The Nodle network has operated as a decentralized physical infrastructure network since its launch, with millions of smartphones contributing to a shared wireless IoT network. As The Nodle Network expands its focus as a digital trust network, and smart missions, maximum decentralization and censorship resistance is essential.

The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance redundancy against malicious actors and network updates, and expand control of the network to its daily active users. With one of the largest mobile userbases in DePIN, NGP001 aims to create a pathway for mobile users to vote in-app.

## Specifications

| Voting type | Token weighted |
| --- | --- |
| DAO purview | Protocol Changes |
| Vote issuer | Nodle DAO, Intergalactic Labs |
| Warm Up period | 1 week (more for this NGP) |
| Voting period | 1 month max |
| Security Council | Yes |
| Security Council Revert Period | 1 month |
| Governance Contract / Frontend | TBD (likely Tally) |
| Balance Snapshot Tool | TBD |

This NGP proposes a token weighted governance model where one NODL token gets one vote. Proposals may be submitted by the Foundation or Lab, with a 1 week warm up period, and voted on for a period of 1 week.

In the early phase of governance, proposals may be issued by the Nodle DAO Foundation, or Intergalactic labs.

## Rationale

The result is the Network is predominantly controlled by small accounts (generally regular users of the Nodle App). The goal is to have a higher than normal voter turnout (>10,000 participating voters ) with a DAO.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Security Considerations

A security council shall be put in place for the early stages of the DAO, with future proposals to further decentralize. The Council May revert protocol changes for a period of up to one month.

## Future Considerations

The following points may be considered for future governance proposals:

1. Allowing anyone to propose protocol changes
2. Open elections for security council
3. Decentralized Treasurhttps://github.com/danhendo89/governance/blob/main/README.mdy management
